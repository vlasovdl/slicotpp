# slicotpp

The goal of this project is to create a software shell that allows the use of
the [SLICOT](https://www.slicot.org/) library in C/C++ programs. The SLICOT
subroutine library provides Fortran 77 implementations of numerical algorithms
for computing in systems and control theory. Based on the numerical linear
algebra procedures from the BLAS and LAPACK libraries, SLICOT provides methods
for designing and analyzing control systems.
